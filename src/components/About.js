      <p>
        I’m a first-year engineering student at the University of Toronto, currently in the Track One program. This allows me to explore various engineering disciplines before specialising. In my second year, I will major in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Sustainable Energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m actively involved in many extracurriculars. This includes the University of Toronto Amateur Radio Society, University of Toronto Chemical Vehicles, and UTWind.
